 # Real Estate Asset Management analysis
This file contains all the projects I did during my internship to study the real estate asset management software industry in the U.S., including:
* An overview of existing asset and property management software solutions.
* Analyze the market size by calculating Whiterock's Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).
* Analyzed RealPage and AppFolio's financial reports from 2013 to 2020 to understand their revenue, market, and expense growths.
* Whiterock's Potential Growth Prediction over the next five years.
* AppFolio's financial analysis to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of the business to make recommendations for Whiterock's product and go-to-market strategy.
